        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Layering the pizza</h3>
        <p>Layer the ingredients one way, and you have pizza perfection. Arrange the same ingredients in a different order, and it's curtains. For example, if you put the cheese down first, then layer tomatoes and basil on top, the basil burns and shrivels and the cheese doesn't brown. Possible pizza fail.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, you can put tomato slices on top of the cheese. Tomatoes have a high moisture content, so they won't caramelize; instead, they'll dehydrate slightly for a more concentrated tomato flavor.</p>
        <h3>Choosing Cheeses</h3>
        <p>Mozzarella, Fontina, and Parmesan cheeses all work great. These cheeses are all very low in moisture, so they'll brown fairly quickly. Fresh mozzarella has a lot of water content and could make surrounding crust and toppings soggy.</p>
